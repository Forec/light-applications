# Welcome to Forec's Light-Application Repository
This repository is an index for several self-made light-applications, for fun and practice. Written in C/C++, Python2.7, Python3.5 and Golang 1.7.3, maybe more languages further. The repository will be in continuously improvement in future. **If you have thoughts for any of them, please [e-mail me](mailto:forec@bupt.edu.cn) or just open your PR, I am very glad to learn from your brilliant idea.**

## Introductions
* Basic practice for [**assembly languages（汇编语言基础练习题）**](https://github.com/Forec/assembly-exercise), you can give yourself a test and push your code into that repository. 
* Simple [**Remote-Control（远程控制）**](https://github.com/Forec/remote-control) program with graphical user interface, Written in C++. 
* An ugly [**DLL-Injection（DLL注入）**](https://github.com/Forec/inject-windows-dll) tool without GUI, Written in C++. A x64 **DLL template（DLL模板）** is also in that repository, which can be used in injection.
* Small script for BUPT students, including: automatically calculating gpa, logining into GW, etc. Careful, **These scripts are customized for BUPT（脚本仅可在北京邮电大学校内使用）** ( Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications ). Details see [here](https://github.com/Forec/scripts-for-bupt).
* A txt-player, display many txts in CMD view just like movies. You can use this tool to **transform a video into many txts and display them（将一个视频文件转换为一系列用符号表示的txt文件）**. Details see [here](https://github.com/Forec/txt-player).
* A simple [**video chat（视频聊天工具）**](https://github.com/Forec/lan-ichat) program, support both IPv4 and IPv6, the current version can support all the network conditions includeing hosts in different protocals.

* [**Port Scanner（端口扫描工具）**](https://github.com/Forec/port-scanner), a simple tool which is familiar to everyone, written in three different languages.
* [**Image Message I/O（图片为载体的信息读写库）**](https://github.com/Forec/image-message-io), small but useful tool for fun.
* [**Monitor Recorder（运动检测监控记录工具）**](https://github.com/Forec/monitor-recorder), a program designed for monitoring and recording unnormal actions. Just like what the normal monitors do.
* [**Fweb-Frame（初学者的Web框架）**](https://github.com/Forec/fweb-frame), written in C++, a good example for learning web frames. 
* [**Markov-Speaking（马尔科夫链随机语言生成库）**](https://github.com/Forec/Markov-Speaking), written in `Python 2.7`, can generate English/Chinese random sentences based on the trainning file. 
* Capture [**Text-Cooccurrence（文本共现）**](https://github.com/Forec/text-cooccurrence) network from a novel and visualize it.
* A simple [**File Transfer（文件传输/FTP）**](https://github.com/Forec/simple-go-ftp) tool, written in Golang 1.7.3.
* [**Cloud Storage（云存储）**](https://github.com/Forec/cloud-storage), written in Golang 1.7.3, will be finished in one or two months, it will include a simple package for developing basic cloud storage server/client (Also includes a web server for non-client users and an app for android, that will be put in other repositories).
