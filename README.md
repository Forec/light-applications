# Welcome to Forec's Light-Application Repository
This repository is an index for several self-made light-applications, for fun and practice. Written in C/C++, Python2.7, Python3.5 and Golang 1.6, maybe more languages further. The repository will be in continuously improvement in future. **If you have thoughts for any of them, please [e-mail me](mailto:forec@bupt.edu.cn) or just open your PR, I am very glad to learn from your brilliant idea.**
