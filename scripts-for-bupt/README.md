# Scripts For BUPT
> Projects in this directory are some little scripts for convenience, customized for BUPT students (ok, just me)...

## Introductions
* **get-your-gpa**: Help you get your gpa easily, no need to login into URP, even no CAPTCHA (check code) needed. The script will help list all your scores and give you a summarized GPA. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/get-your-gpa/README.md).
* **login-GW**: Help you login into the GW (10.3.8.211) automatically. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/login-bupt-gw/README.md).
