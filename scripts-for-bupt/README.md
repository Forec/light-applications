# Scripts For BUPT
> Projects in this directory are some little scripts for convenience, customized for BUPT students (ok, just me)...

## Introductions
* **get-your-gpa**: Help you get your gpa easily, no need to login into URP, even no CAPTCHA (check code) needed. The script will help list all your scores and give you a summarized GPA. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/get-your-gpa).
* **login-GW**: Help you login into the GW (10.3.8.211) automatically. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/login-bupt-gw).
* draw-CAPTCHA: Help you generate a CAPTCHA picture, with your assigned width (height is width/2), and assigned count of numbers/letters in the CAPTCHA. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/draw-CAPTCHA)
