# CAPTCHA Generator
> This project is a script for generating **CAPTCHA** automatically, you just need to assign your requirements, or use the default settings.

## Platform
This small script is written in python 2.7, using `PIL`. You can install by executing an executable binary file from [here](http://effbot.org/media/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe). Choose your version.
* **Attentions**: The deafult setting for this script is: 4 numbers/letters in the generated CAPTCHA, width is 400, height is 200. You can assign how many numbers/letters in the CAPTCHA, and the `width`. Height is just `[width / 2]`.

## Usage
The python version is 2.7, so just `python CAPTCHA.py <id> <pwd>`, the script will create a CAPTCHA named `out.jpg`. Also, I build an executable binary file, you can just download the `CAPTCHA.exe` from my cloud storage: [here](http://7xktmz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/CAPTCHA.exe).

## Update-logs
