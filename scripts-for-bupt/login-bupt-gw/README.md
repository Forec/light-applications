# GW-AutoLogin
> This project is a small script for **Login the GW** automatically, which is the gateway `10.3.8.211` for BUPT.

## Platform
This small script is written in python 2.7, all packages being used are built-in packages.

## Usage
Just run `python login.py <id> <pwd>`, you can write this as a `.sh` on Linux or `.bat` on Windows. Also, you can just download `login.exe` from my cloud storage: [here](http://7xktmz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/login.exe). Put the bash file in your auto-start list, no more GW login actinos.

## Update-logs
* 2016-9-04: Add `login.py`.
* 2016-9-19: Fix problems for logining into `10.4.1.2`. Add `sleep` to avoid the initial time for system.
